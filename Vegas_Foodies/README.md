#### Abstract

The purpose of this data mining project is to examine how restaurants can improve their Yelp
profile to become more “successful” on Yelp in Las Vegas, Nevada. Differently from the traditional
approaches to this dataset, our methodology defines “success” as a binary variable through an
exploratory analysis of the restaurants’ review counts and ratings on Yelp. Feature variables include
categories and attributes that Yelp users can use to select which restaurant to visit. For this project, we
ran Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to explore key features associated with
“success” and obtain recommendations for restaurants to improve their Yelp profile. Final results
indicate that determinants of success vary by cuisine type.
