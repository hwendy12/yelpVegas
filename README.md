**Abstract:**\
The purpose of this data mining project is to examine how restaurants can improve their Yelp profile to become 
more “successful” on Yelp in Las Vegas, Nevada.\
\
Different from the traditional approaches to this dataset, 
our methodology defines “success” as a binary variable through an exploratory analysis of the restaurants’ 
review counts and ratings on Yelp. Feature variables include categories and attributes that Yelp users can use 
to select which restaurant to visit. For this project, we ran Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression 
to explore key features associated with “success” and obtain recommendations for restaurants to improve their Yelp profile. 
Final results indicate that determinants of success vary by cuisine type.
